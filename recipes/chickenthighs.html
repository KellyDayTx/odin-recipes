    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you want a dinner that is simple, inexpensive, but full of flavor you don't need to look further than this recipe for crispy oven-roasted chicken thighs.  Chicken thighs are dark meat which is the portion of the chicken that has more fat but that's where flavor comes from.  We're leaving the skin on for even more flavor and of course the crispy skin.  Yum!</p>
