<h1>Fried Eggs (over hard, break the yolks)</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the wild world of fried eggs.  If you've ever been to a Waffle House you have probably heard eggs ordered in a number of different ways.  You may have your preferred order.  Mine is "over hard break the yolks" when I order fried eggs.  I do like scrambled but with restaurants using egg substitutes I like to know I'm getting real eggs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your preferred number and size of eggs (2 work for me as part of a breakfast)</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Non-stick pan</li>
            <li>Spatula</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the pan to medium-high.</li>
            <li>Place a tablespoon of butter in the pan once it's up to temperature.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg (or eggs if the pan allows) into the melted butter.</li>
            <li>Use the egg shell to apply pressure to the yolk(s) until it breaks.</li>
            <li>Wait approximately 1 minute and then flip.  If you're feeling fancy you can flip it like a pancake.  This maneuver takes skill so be careful!</li>
            <li>Monitor the egg for your favorite doneness and then move them to a plate.  Season to taste and enjoy!</li>
