    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here we have two wonderful ribeye steaks ready to be cooked.  The ribeye is known as one of the most flavorful cuts of steaks.  It is easy to prepare and takes just a little bit of practice to get right.  For this recipe we are going to use the cast-iron skillet method.  Follow along and see if my cooking method works for you.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Well marbled ribeye steak (approximately 16oz)</li>
            <li>Cast iron skillet that is large enough to hold the steak</li>
            <li>A large spoon for basting</li>
            <li>Meat thermometer</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter (room temperature if possible)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cooking oil with a high smoke point (Grapeseed oil is preferred but you can use olive oil if that's what you have)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Liberally salt both sides of the steaks and put them on a plate or pan.</li>
            <li>Allow steaks to rest covered on a plate or pan for approximately 30 minutes.  This helps the steak cook faster and more evenly.</li>
            <li>Start heating up the skillet about 5 minutes bofore you're ready to cook.  Medium-high heat is recommended.</li>
            <li>When the pan is well heated add your oil.  The oil should reach the pans heat within 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is up to temperature, place one steak in it.  We're going to let it cook on each side for approximately two or two and a half minutes.</li>
            <li>Once you flip the steak for the first time add a generous amount of butter.  1 tablespoon or so.</li>
            <li>Carefully tilt the pan so the butter pools near the edge.  Now use your spoon to scoop the butter up and baste the steak while it cooks.</li>
            <li>Check for doneness with your thermometer.  We want the temperature to be around 125 degrees fahrenheit.  The steak will continue to cook once it's removed.  If you'd like your steak cooked to a different doneness, you can leave it in the pan longer and continue to monitor the temperature</li>
            <li>Once the steak has reached your desired doneness, remove it to rest.  You can cover it with foil but it's not required.</li>
            
        </ol>
